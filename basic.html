        <h1>A little bit about me!</h1>
        
        <h2>My intro</h2>
            <p> I am from Evanston, IL, the first suburb north of Chicago. I am a dual magazine journalism major in Newhouse and a psychology major in the College of Arts and Sciences with a minor in political science. I love to hear and tell stories, and I am passionate about reporting in a way that widens people's persepctives and helps them gain empathy. I love to write about my own interests, incuding music, food (I am a <strong>HUGE</strong> foodie), and politics. I also love to spend time with friends and family, workout, listen to music, study, and spend time outside. My friends and family, composed of my 21 old brother and parents, are two of the most important parts of my life. </p>
