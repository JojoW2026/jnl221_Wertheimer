			<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.cps.edu/press-releases/five-cps-high-schools-among-top-100-in-nation/" target="_blank">U.S. News and World Report</a> ranked five Chicago high schools in the top 100 high schools in the nation. The rankings came from a pool of data on 24,000 public high schools, with Chicago’s Walter Payton College Prep, located near the city’s affluent Gold Coast, number five.</p>
			<p>However, the experience of Black and Hispanic students in CPS often looks very different from their white peers. Many times, it’s an educational experience far from one that is nationally ranked. In CPS, over 80% of schools with a majority white student population have received top level ratings from the district, compared to 23% of schools that are majority Hispanic and only 11% of schools that are majority Black, based on 2022-2023 <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-School-Profile-Information-/9a5f-2r4p/about_data" target="_blank">CPS school profile data </a>. Some of this inequity can be attributed to white flight and white families pulling their students, and resources, out of public schools and funneling them into private institutions, according to Pavlyn Jankov, research manager at Chicago Teachers Union.</p>
			<p>“In CPS, there’s actually very few schools that are majority white… One of the main drivers of that is white families continue having access to the kinds of resources where they’re not investing by putting their kids into CPS schools. On top of that, we have segregation, and Black communities being predominantly on the South and West sides [of the city]. Those are the communities that have been disinvested in,” said Jankov.</p>
			<p>Within CPS, disinvestment in Chicago’s Black and Hispanic communities is overt. In the 2022-2023 school year, both majority Black and majority Hispanic CPS schools had an average low income student population of 76%. Majority white schools, on the other hand, had an average low income student population of 16%. Chaundhry attributes some of this inequity to Chicago’s history of redlining, the practice of denying housing in specific areas to certain marginalized groups.</p>

			<p>“It all came down to how they were dividing the city up to allow for property ownership for people of color. So even if you were successful, you were Black, you had money—you just couldn’t buy property in certain segments of Chicago. You can see it today where you have a high concentration of community residents who don’t own and there’s no generational wealth being passed down,” he said.</p>
			<p>With racist housing policies permeating the city in the early 20th century and a history of slavery and oppression in the U.S., it’s incredibly difficult for Black Chicagoans to gain generational wealth from housing. However, many white families have had unlimited access to housing in “good” neighborhoods and continue to compound centuries of housing based generational wealth.</p>
			<p>For Chaundhry, the buildup of stark inequity in Chicago is best explained as a game of Monopoly. In this game, Chaundhry’s turn comes first. He rolls and moves his piece. But when the second player reaches for the dice, Chaundhry rolls again. Then again. He rolls the dice over and over until the second player is extremely upset—their turn has been taken from them an infinite number of times. Finally, after explaining to Chaundhry how the game’s been unfair, Chaundhry gives the second player an infinite number of turns to try and catch up, or even win. But can they?</p>
			<p>“Hypothetically if I bought all the property already, even if I gave you an infinite number of chances, it depends. Do I own everything? Do I have houses and hotels on every property? It doesn't matter how many times you roll, you will never be able to beat the system that I have in place until that system changes. So when we talk about socioeconomic inequities between Black, Brown, white, Asian [people], historically speaking, we have to look at policies. We have to look at systems. We have to look at structures, we have to look at history,” Chaundhry said.</p>
			<p>Even if marginalized groups have received support, equity relies on an overhaul of structure, he continued.</p>
			<p>“We have to redo the monopoly rules or I have to forfeit some of my properties and homes in order to give you a fair chance to even break even in this game.”</p>
			<p>Recently, CPS implemented a major change to try and level the playing field: the way they evaluate school performance. The School Quality Rating Policy Rating—which, according to the <a href="https://www.cps.edu/about/district-data/metrics/sqrp/" target="_blank">CPS website</a> hasn’t been used since 2019 but was used in the CPS school profile data produced in 2022—is based on a variety of “indicators of success.” These indicators include student test scores, academic growth, closing of achievement gaps, school environment, attendance, graduation and preparation for post-grad success, among other things. Schools could receive a rating of 1+ (the highest score) 1, 2+, 2, or 3 (the lowest score). With indicators rooted in access to resources and lacking socioeconomic context, the scores of majority white institutions soared above their majority Black and Hispanic counterparts. Not only did this influence school investment and enrollment, but it has also incited potential closures of schools, predominantly Black and Brown, that are performing more “poorly.”</p>

			<p>In response to inequitable school data and public concerns, CPS is redesigning their school measurement system so school performance, which is influenced greatly by access to resources, is not a direct measurement of school quality. To re-evaluate distribution of resources, the CPS office of equity turned to a tool called the Opportunity Index. </p>
			<p>“I appreciate it because it really helps us make data informed decisions of how we allocate funds,” said Chaundhry, referencing a hypothetical situation in which a company like AT&T wants to partner with CPS to give away 10,000 cell phones. “Historically, without this data set, it would be like, ‘who would be give it to?’ You’d give it to the schools who had the most political power, or you’d give it to the schools that were historically identified as highest need.”</p>
			<p>Now, however, the Opportunity Index assesses need with 12 indicators that give schools a score on how far or how close the school is to equity. The indicators are based on factors relating to systemic structural inequities, including environmental, community and demographic features like social determinants of health. A score of five indicates a school is furthest from opportunity with significant inequities, whereas a score of zero indicates lots of opportunity and little inequity. In the last three years, the index has been used to reallocate over $150 million to schools identified as high priority, or furthest from opportunity, according to Chaundhry.</p>
			<p>But even with initiatives like the Opportunity Index, CPS and the city itself remains a microcosm of our country, still straining under the effects of centuries of systemic racism and oppression.</p>
			<p>“We’re at this point where we’ve pushed back on some of the worst kinds of policies, but we still need a lot more to actually improve our communities,” said Jankov. “For years, I would say decades—going back to the 80s when the [federal education secretary] called CPS the worst schools system in the country—there’s this intense targeting of urban school districts for the failures of resourcing. It’s not a failure of the communities, or of the teachers or of the parents… There’s just a tremendous gap between what CPS has and what they need.”</p>
